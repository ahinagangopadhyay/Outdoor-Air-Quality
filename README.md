# 🌫️ Outdoor-Air-Quality

- Collected outdoor air quality data for cities across India from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) web portal, covering key pollutants and meteorological parameters.  
- Utilized Pandas and NumPy for data cleaning, preprocessing, and efficient numerical operations on large-scale environmental datasets.  
- Applied Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering using Scikit-learn to group cities season-wise based on air quality trends and similarities.  
- Employed Matplotlib for visualizing seasonal clusters and spatial patterns to support analysis and interpretation of outdoor air quality.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Pandas** – data cleaning and manipulation  
- **NumPy** – numerical operations  
- **Scikit-learn** – clustering (Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering)  
- **Matplotlib** – data visualization
